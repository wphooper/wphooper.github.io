</div>

<div><p><b>Attendance:</b>
You should attend every class but
extenuating circumstances arise that can
make this difficult. If you cannot attend a
class, please let me know. If
circumstances make you miss more than
3 classes during the semester, you may
be overextended. I ask that you come see
me to discuss your options.</p>
</div>

<div><p><b>Class participation:</b>
In order to learn mathematics, it is important to participate actively: asking questions, answering questions, and suggesting ideas. All of us in the class, you, me, your peers,
have a responsibility to create an
environment in which this is possible. It is important to note that students in this class come from a range of background and have different paparedness for the material in this course. In particular, I expect everyone to be an active participant, and supportive of other participants and to work towards maximizing collective learning.</p>
</div>

<div><p><b>General expectations:</b> For each hour spent in the classroom, I expect you to spend at least three hours reading and understanding the book, understanding lecture notes, doing homework<!--, and programming-->. Practice (doing problems) is an important part of learning. Only adequate practice will guarantee that you can complete exam problems in a timely manner.</p>
</div>

<div><b>Expectations of written work:</b> Grades assigned to mathematical arguments will be partially based on presentation. In order to receive full credit, a student who reads your answer should be able to easily understand how you solved the problem. Written work is expected to be legible and arguments are expected to be well articulated.</div>

<div><b>Grades:</b> Grades will be computed from the following weighted average:
	<ul>
		<li>Homework, Classwork, and Quizzes (30%)</li>
		<li>Exam grade (70%)</li>
	</ul>
    <p>The exam grade will be a weighted average of the final exam and midterm grades, with each midterm counting half as much as the final exam.</p>
    <p>The exam grade will be a weighted average of the midterm exams taken. I expect
    to offer two midterms.</p>
	<p>Your grade percentage will be tabulated out of 100% as indicated by the percentages above. Letter grades will be assigned to you according to the following list:
	A+ (97-100), A (95-96), A- (90-94), B+ (87-89), B (84-86), B- (80-83), C+ (77-79), C (74-76), F (0-69).	</p>
</div>

<div><b>Cross-listing:</b> 
This is a Master’s course which is cross-listed with an undergraduate course. While the topics covered will be identical, the level of mastery expected will be different. In particular, exams will differ. In the Master’s course, exams will have a greater focus on theory than the undergraduate exams, and students are expected to make good use of theoretical results to make more general arguments. In the undergraduate course, problems are more likely to focus on computations. Also, there are differences are in the number of homework grades dropped, and there will be different expectations in the quality of written work. Some assignments might have different variants for graduate students and for undergraduate students.
</div>

<div><b>Course website:</b> Course information, homework assignments, and documents can be found
on the website:
<div class="center"><a href="http://wphooper.com/teaching/2024-spring-a6300">http://wphooper.com/teaching/2024-spring-a6300</a></div>
</div>

<div><b>Brightspace:</b> I use Brightspace to keep track of your grades. To access Brightspace visit:
<div class="center"><a href="https://brightspace.cuny.edu">https://brightspace.cuny.edu</a></div>
Solutions to problems and other materials may also be posted to brightspaces.
</div>

<div><p><b>Homework assignments:</b> Homework will be assigned approximately once a week and will have a due date.
Homework assignments will be made available on the course website at least one week before the assignment is due.</p>

<p>I encourage you to work in groups on the homework problems, especially if this best suits your learning style. Nonetheless, you should be confident that you understand how to do each problem, and should be able to solve similar problems independently. Failure to ensure that you can solve problems independently will surely have a negative effect on quiz and exam grades.</p>

<p>If you do work jointly with other students, you must acknowledge this. All work turned in must be written in your own words. Failure to follow these guidlines constitutes plagarism; see the discussion of Academic Integrity below.</p>

<p>Problem sets have a mix of assigned homework problems, some assigned for you to do, and some assigned for you to turn in. You are expected to think carefully about all these problems as I anticipate a failure to do so adversely affecting your exam grades. Please only turn in problems which are marked to be turned in.</p>
</div>

<div><b>Quizzes and Classwork:</b> At this point, I do not anticipate collecting classwork or giving quizzes, but this could change if the need becomes apparent as we move through the course. There will be no makeups for missed quizzes or classwork.</div>

<div><b>Dropped grades:</b> 
The lowest one-sixth (16.6%) of assignments in the &ldquo;Homework, Classwork, and Quizzes&rdquo; category will be dropped (rounding up if necessary).</div>

<div><b>Late homework:</b> Late homework will not be accepted for any reason. If you need to miss class, please scan and email your assignment to me as a PDF document before the start of class on the day it is due.</p>

<p>The dropped grades are intended to compensate for missed assignments due to circumstances beyond your control. If however you feel that these dropped grades are insufficient to rectify the negative impact on your grade by your circumstances, please reach out to me.</p></div>

<div>
<p><b>Midterm exams:</b> There will be two midterm exams. They will be held in class on the following dates: March 10, and April 9. You will be given the full class period to complete each midterm.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><b>Final exam:</b>
	The Final Exam will be held at the time scheduled by the college.
	The final exam will be held on Monday, May 19th from 6:00pm to 8:15pm. For the most up to date information about the time of the final exam, see the <a href="https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/registrar/spring-2025-final-exam-schedule">Registrar's Final Exam Schedule</a>.
    </p>
</div>

<div><p><b>Exam makeups:</b> A single midterm missed under well-documented and sufficiently compelling circumstance will result in that grade not counting towards your <q>Exam grade</q> portion of the course grade. (So in this case your Exam grade will be the average of the remaining midterms.)

<p>If two midterms are missed under well-documented and sufficiently compelling circumstances, an offer of a makeup for the second midterm will be made. The makeup must be taken within one week of the scheduled exam, or a zero will be assigned as the exam grade.</p>

<p>Similarly if the final exam is missed under well-documented and sufficiently compelling circumstances, an offer of a makeup for the final exam will be made. The makeup must be taken within one week of the scheduled exam, or a zero will be assigned as the exam grade.</p>

<p>Exceptions to the one week time period will only be made if a student can prove that they are unable to take the exam that week for compelling reasons.</p>

<p>Notify me ahead of any exam you expect to miss to be sure your circumstances are sufficiently compelling.</p>

<p>At the department’s or the instructor’s discretion, any makeup exam may be administered as an oral examination carried out either in-person or using video-conferencing software (such as Zoom).</p>
</div>

<div><p><b>Academic Integrity:</b> All work submitted for this course should be your own unless explicitly stated or acknowledged by you. This course follows the <a href="http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/about/integrity">CUNY Policy on Academic Integrity Policy</a>. The college takes academic integrity issues seriously. Violations will be pursued as described in this policy. Punishments for violating this policy include academic pentalties such as zero on the assignment or failure in the course, as well disciplinary sanctions such as suspension and expulsion from the college.
</p>

<p>In particular, it is expected that you not plagarize. This has been especially problematic on homework. Your homework must not be copied from another source, and you must cite any sources used when preparing your solutions. Sources can include textbooks, webpages, discussions with other people, and other student work. Citations should be as specific as possible. All submitted work must be written in your own words.</p>

<p>The updated Academic Integrity Policy explicitly forbids copying from generative AI, and will be enforced in this course. Review the policy for full details of what is forbidden.</p>
</div>

<div><p><b>AccessAbility Center:</b>
The AccessAbility Center/Student Disability Services ensures equal access and full participation to all of City College's programs, services, and activities by coordinating and implementing appropriate accommodations. If you are a student with a disability who requires accommodations and services, please visit the office in NAC 1/218, or contact AAC/SDS via email (<a href="mailto:disabilityservices@ccny.cuny.edu">disabilityservices@ccny.cuny.edu</a>), or phone (212-650-5913 or TTY/TTD 212-650-8441).
</p>
</div>

<div><b>Video lectures:</b> Students who participate in video lectures for this class with their camera on or use a profile image are agreeing to have their video or image recorded solely for the purpose of creating a record for students enrolled in the class to refer to, including those enrolled students who are unable to attend live. If you are unwilling to consent to have your profile or video image recorded, be sure to keep your camera off and do not use a profile image. Likewise, students who un-mute during class and participate orally are agreeing to have their voices recorded. If you are not willing to consent to have your voice recorded during class, you will need to keep your mute button activated and communicate exclusively using the “chat” feature, which allows students to type questions and comments live.</div>
